## Swift Code Documentation

### Purpose:
The provided Swift code defines a `RecipeDetails` struct, which is intended to represent details about a recipe. It conforms to the `Codable` protocol, allowing instances of this struct to be encoded to and decoded from JSON data.

### Structure:
1. **Struct Definition (`RecipeDetails`):**
   - This struct contains various properties representing different details of a recipe, such as `id`, `name`, `instructions`, `ingredients`, and `measures`.
   - It also contains an enum `CodingKeys`, which defines the coding keys used for encoding and decoding.
   - The `init(from:)` method is used for decoding JSON data, and the `encode(to:)` method is used for encoding the struct into JSON data.

### Functionality:
1. **Properties:**
   - `id`: Represents the unique identifier of the recipe.
   - `name`: Represents the name of the recipe.
   - `instructions`: Represents the cooking instructions for the recipe.
   - `ingredients`: Represents the list of ingredients required for the recipe.
   - `measures`: Represents the measurements corresponding to each ingredient.

2. **Enum `CodingKeys`:**
   - Defines coding keys to map between the struct's properties and their corresponding keys in the JSON data.

3. **`init(from:)` Method:**
   - Custom decoding logic is implemented in this method.
   - It decodes JSON data into struct properties, such as `id`, `name`, `instructions`, `ingredients`, and `measures`.
   - It iterates through a range of indices (1 to 20) to decode ingredients and measures dynamically.

4. **`encode(to:)` Method:**
   - Custom encoding logic is implemented in this method.
   - It encodes struct properties (`id`, `name`, and `instructions`) into a JSON container.
   - `ingredients` and `measures` are excluded from encoding since they are not directly mapped to struct properties.

### Documentation:
   - **Purpose:** Defines a Swift struct to represent details about a recipe and enables encoding and decoding of JSON data.
   - **Struct Definition:** Defines the `RecipeDetails` struct with properties for recipe details and custom coding keys enum.
   - **Functionality:** Provides custom decoding logic to decode JSON data into the struct and custom encoding logic to encode the struct into JSON data.
   - **Usage:** Users can create instances of the `RecipeDetails` struct and encode/decode them to/from JSON data.
